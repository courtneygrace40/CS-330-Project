# Libraries in C++

Libraries are used in C++ with #include \<libraryName\> at the top of a file. One of the most common libraries, #include \<iostream\>, is used in nearly every C++ file because it allows for the input and output of information to and from the terminal. 

## How To Use Libraries

Many libraries are included when C++ is downloaded, but some are more complex. The more complex libraries must be downloaded through the computer terminal. Every library is different, but most (on Mac) can use "homebrew" to download.
