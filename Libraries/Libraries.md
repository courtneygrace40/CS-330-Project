# Libraries in C++

Libraries are used in C++ with #include \<libraryName\> at the top of a file. One of the most common libraries, #include \<iostream\>, is used in nearly every C++ file because it allows for the input and output of information to and from the terminal. 

## How To Use Libraries

Many libraries are included when C++ is downloaded, but some are more complex. The more complex libraries must be downloaded through the computer terminal. Every library is different, but most (on Mac) can use "homebrew" to download. 

### Downloading Homebrew

To download homebrew, you need to follow these steps. 
1. Open Terminal
2. Enter this command exactly: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
3. Check to see if it is installed correctly by entering this command: brew help

### Example Library: NCurses
