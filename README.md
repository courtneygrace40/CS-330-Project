## Language overview and setup

### History
C++ is an **object-oriented programming language** that was created as an extension to the C language in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. The major difference is that C++ supports classes and objects while C does not. One of the strengths of C++ is the amount of control that is given to the programmer. Currently, C++ is the second most popular programming language in the world. 


Some of the uses of C++ include:  
- Video games
- Graphical applications and simulations
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Embedded software 
- Audio and video processing


For history, I used https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-cplusplus/.  
To learn C++, I will be using:

### Hello World Program
Type this code into your program:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```
This will run "Hello, World!", the first program programmers run when learning a new language.
