## Language overview and setup

### History
C++ was created as an extension to the C language in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. The major difference is that C++ supports classes and objects while C does not. One of the strengths of C++ is the amount of control that is given to the programmer. Currently, C++ is the second most popular programming language in the world. 

Some of the uses of C++ include: 
  - Video games
  - Graphical applications and simulations
  - Artificial Intelligence 
  - Embedded software 
  - Audio and video processing
