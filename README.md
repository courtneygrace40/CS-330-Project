## Language Overview and Setup

### History
C++ is an **object-oriented programming language** that was created as an extension to the C language in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. The major difference is that C++ supports classes and objects while C does not. One of the strengths of C++ is the amount of control that is given to the programmer. Currently, C++ is the second most popular programming language in the world. 


Some of the uses of C++ include:  
- Video games
- Graphical applications and simulations
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Embedded software 
- Audio and video processing


For history, I used https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-cplusplus/.  
To learn C++, I will be using:
  - https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp 
  - https://www.codecademy.com/


### Hello World Program
Type this code into your program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>  //This imports a library used for objects in C++
using namespace std;  //This allows the program to use names from the library

int main() { // This is the main function, which is required for every C++ program
cout << "Hello World!"; //'cout' prints information to the terminal 
return 0; //This ends the main function 
}
```
This will run "Hello, World!", the first program programmers run when learning a new language.  

## Syntax and Conventions 

### Variables

Here are the rules for naming variables in C++:
- Variables **MUST** begin with a letter or an underscore 
- Variables can contain letters, digits, and underscores
- Case-sensitive 
- Variables cannot contain whitespace or special characters 

### Conventions 

C++ is a statically, strongly, and explicitly typed language. 
- **statically typed:** values are attached to types at composite time
- **strongly typed:** 
- **explicitly typed:** type of variable needs to be declared
